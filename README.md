# react-travel-app
A travel app using React 

For one of the projects in our course, we were asked to create a reactive and responsive website using JavaScript or React. I choose to use React based off its flexibility, and since it's widely used in the industry. 

For my project, I am using the Skyscanner API to gather flight data so the user can book their next trip. My working title is Nomader, based off the fact that in the past, I have been a remote worker, or digital nomad, while traveling the world.
